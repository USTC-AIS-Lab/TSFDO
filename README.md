# TSFDO

**TSFDO** (Two-Stage Filter-Based Distributed Odometry) is a fully distributed odometry framework for multi-robot systems (MRSs), built upon the invariant extended Kalman filter. It tightly integrates LiDAR, IMU, and UWB measurements, enabling each robot in the system to estimate the global state rather than only a local subset of states through inter-robot communication and distributed information fusion.

To evaluate the performance and advantages of this distributed odometry framework, we conduct a series of experiments using both a public dataset, S3E and data collected by ourselves.

  <em>figure4.  Trajectories of the ground robot when collecting sequences: Sequence-GR_1 (blue), Sequence-GR_2 (yellow), and Sequence-GR_3 (red)</em>
</p>

Four UAVs form a multi-robot system for data collection. For the ground robot dataset, data are collected by a single robot. 

Specifically, the data obtained from three different trajectories, containing IMU and LiDAR measurements, are merged into one multi-robot sequence, which is treated as data from a system of three robots as shown in the above figure. Using the ground truth obtained via GNSS, the relative distances among the robots are computed and used as UWB measurements. In this way, a multi-robot dataset containing IMU, LiDAR, and UWB information is constructed. 

These sequences obtained by ground robot are employed to compare the performance of our method with existing cooperative odometry approaches in scenarios where robot trajectories within a multi-robot system do not intersect except for the start point. The choice of the ground robot is motivated by its LiDAR type, since the existing methods in comparison are compatible only with Velodyne LiDAR, whereas our UAVs are equipped with Livox Mid-360 LiDAR.

## 2. Experimental results on the custom dataset

### 2.1 Effectiveness experiments

  <em>figure5.  State estimates and ground truth of Robot 4 on sequence Sequence-UAV_1 of our custom dataset</em>
</p>

This figure shows the comparison among ego-state estimates (blue solid line) , self-state estimates (red solid line), and groud truth on Sequence-UAV_1. It is demonstrated that the UWB-based update effectively improves the accuracy of self-state estimates, even in cases where the self-state estimates are already relatively accurate.

These figures shows the state estimates of four UAVs calculated by the first UAV on Sequence-UAV_4, and the comparison between these estimates and their corresponding groud truths. It can be clearly observed that the robot is able to estimate the states of all other individuals under the connected communication topology given in the following figure, even during intervals when two robots cannot directly exchange information.

  <em>figure12.  Evaluation of mutual state estimation across different joint state estimation processes</em>
  
</p>

We consider three cases for the joint state estimation stage: **1)** the update step is omitted; **2)** the consensus step is omitted; and **3)** all three steps are performed. This table reports the accuracy of mutual state estimation for robot pairs with discontinuous communication in the three cases. 

A comparison between cases 1) and 3) shows that the UWB-based update provides further correction of the mutual-state estimates, but the improvement is limited. Meanwhile, the difference in estimation accuracy between cases 2) and 3) highlights the critical role of the consensus step in ensuring the precision of the mutual state estimation. Based on these facts, the absence of the consensus step will significantly undermine the performance of TSFDO.

 </em>
</p>

This figure shows the state estimates of robot 3 computed by robot 1 under different communication intervals on Sequence-UAV_3, when there is no consensus step in the joint state estimation stage. It is demonstrated that the mutual state estimation accuracy can still be maintained at a relatively higher communication frequency. As the communication interval getting longer, the mutual state estimation performance degrades significantly.
