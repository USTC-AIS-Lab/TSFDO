  <em>figure1.  Framework of the proposed distributed odometry</em>
</p>

1. The fully distributed odometry framework for multi-robot systems cooperative localization problem with dynamic communication topologies, termed **TSFDO**, is a two-stage, filter-based approach that integrates IMU, LiDAR, and UWB measurements in a tightly-coupled invariant extended Kalman filter-based way.

2. Comparative studies against state-of-the-art cooperative localization methods confirm the superior accuracy of the proposed approach.

3. This repository provides the selected figures and data used in the paper *‚ÄúFrom Local Odometry to Global Awareness: A Two-Stage Filter-Based Distributed Odometry for Multi-Robot Systems‚Äù*, for the convenience of researchers to reference and use.

For the ground vehicle dataset, datas are collected by a single robot. Specifically, the data obtained from three different trajectories, containing IMU and LiDAR measurements, are merged into one multi-robot sequence.

    </td>
    
  </tr>
</table>

The results indicate that the UWB-based update effectively improves the accuracy of selfstate estimation, particularly for robots with larger self-state estimation errors. Even in cases where the self-state estimates are already relatively accurate, as on the sequences of custom dataset, incorporating UWB inputs still yields improvements, making the ego-state estimates more accurate.

      <p align="center"><em>figure12. State estimates of Robot 4 computed by Robot 1 on sequence Lawn_4 of our custom dataset</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

It can be clearly observed that the robot is able to estimate the states of all other individuals under the connected communication topology, even during intervals when two robots cannot directly exchange information.

### 3. Accuracy Experiments

      <img src="figures/figure11.png" alt="11" width="450"/>
      <p align="center"><em>figure13. Ego-state estimates of Robot 1 using different approaches on sequence Tunnel_1 of dataset S3E</em></p>

      <p align="center"><em>figure14. Ego-state estimates of Robot 2 using different approaches on sequence Tunnel_1 of dataset S3E</em></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="figures/figure13.png" alt="13" width="450"/>
      <p align="center"><em>figure15. Ego-state estimates of Robot 3 using different approaches on sequence Tunnel_1 of dataset S3E</em></p>
    </td>  
  </tr>
</table>

Comparison of ego-state estimation using different approaches on Tunnel 1 clearly demonstrates the superior accuracy of TSFDO.

### 4. Ablation Experiments

 </em>
</p>

When there is no consensus step in the joint-state estimation stage, the mutual state estimation accuracy can still be maintained at a relatively higher communication frequency. As the communication interval getting longer, the mutual estimation performance degrades significantly.
